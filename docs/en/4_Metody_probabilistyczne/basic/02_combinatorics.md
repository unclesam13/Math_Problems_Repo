# Task List 02 — Combinatorics for Probability

## Introduction

Many probability problems start by counting outcomes: the size of a sample space, the number of favorable outcomes, or the number of possible codes or arrangements. The main difficulty is usually not the formula, but recognizing which counting model applies.

In this task list you will practice:

* identifying the correct counting model,
* translating a problem description into a precise outcome type,
* using the model to count outcomes in probability contexts.

## Key Counting Questions

Before choosing a formula, decide:

1. Does **order** matter?
2. Are we using **all objects** or only **some of them**?
3. Are **repetitions allowed**?
4. Are objects **distinguishable** or **indistinguishable**?
5. What kind of outcome are we describing?
   * a set,
   * a sequence,
   * a linear arrangement,
   * or a circular arrangement?

## Decision Tree for Choosing a Model

The following flowchart provides a quick procedure for identifying the correct counting model.
Students can apply these questions directly when solving exam problems.

Are we using ALL objects?

 ├─ YES

 │
 │   ├─ YES → Circular permutation
 │   │
 │   └─ NO
 │        │
 │        Are some objects identical?
 │
 │        ├─ YES → Permutation with repeated elements
 │        │
 │        └─ NO  → Permutation

 └─ NO (only SOME objects)
     │
     Does order matter?
     │
     ├─ NO  → Combination
     │
     └─ YES
          │
          Is repetition allowed?
          │
          ├─ YES → Sequence with repetition
          │
          └─ NO  → k-permutation
```

When solving a counting problem, students should answer a small sequence of questions:

1. Are we using **all objects or only some of them**?
2. Does **order matter**?
3. Is **repetition allowed**?
4. Are some objects **identical**?

The answers determine which combinatorial model applies.

## Overview of Counting Models

Selections: **combination** (unordered), **k-permutation (ordered selection without repetition)**, **sequence with repetition**.

Arrangements of all objects: **permutation**, **circular permutation**, **permutation with repeated elements**.

---

## Permutations

A **permutation** is an arrangement of all elements of a set, where order matters.

If a set contains $n$ distinct elements, then the number of permutations is

$$
P_n = n!
$$

Permutations are used when:

* all available objects are arranged,
* order matters,
* repetitions are not allowed.

Typical examples:

* arranging books on a shelf, 
* seating people in a row, 
* ordering questions in a test.

---

## Circular Permutations

When objects are arranged in a circle, rotations may represent the same arrangement.

If $n$ distinct objects are arranged around a circle and only relative position matters, then the number of circular permutations is

$$
(n-1)!
$$

This model is used when:

* objects are arranged around a round table, 
* absolute position is irrelevant,
* only relative placement matters.

---

## Combinations

A **combination** is a selection of elements where order does not matter.

The number of ways to choose $k$ elements from $n$ distinct elements is

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

Combinations are used when:

* only some objects are chosen,
* order does not matter,
* repetition is not allowed.

Typical examples:

* choosing a committee,
* selecting cards from a deck,
* choosing endpoints of a segment.

---

## k-Permutations (Ordered Selections Without Repetition)

In some European textbooks the term "variation" is used for ordered selections.
In this course we use the standard English terminology: **k-permutations** (ordered selections).

A **k-permutation** (or ordered selection without repetition) is an ordered selection of $k$ elements from an $n$-element set, where no element may be used more than once.

The number of such ordered selections is

$$
P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
$$

This model is used when:

* only some objects are chosen,
* order matters,
* repetition is not allowed.

Typical examples:

* assigning medals,
* forming numbers with distinct digits,
* choosing ordered positions.

---

## Sequences With Repetition

A **sequence of length $(k)$** over an $(n)$-element set is an ordered selection where each position may contain any of the $(n)$ symbols and repetition is allowed.

The number of such sequences is

$$
n^k
$$

This model is used when:

* order matters,
* repetition is allowed,
* each position is chosen independently.

Typical examples:

* PIN codes,
* repeated coin tosses,
* repeated die rolls,
* telephone numbers.

---

## Permutations with Repeated Elements

When some objects are identical, the number of distinct permutations must account for indistinguishable elements. These are called **permutations with repeated elements** (or **permutations of a multiset**).

If among $n$ objects there are:

* $n_1$ identical objects of one type,
* $n_2$ identical objects of another type,
* and so on,

then the number of distinct arrangements is

$$
\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\dots n_r!}
$$

This model is used when:

* objects of the same type are indistinguishable,
* all objects are arranged,
* order matters at the level of positions, but equal objects are treated as identical.

Typical examples:

* arranging colored balls,
* arranging letters with repeated symbols.

---

## Distinguishable and Indistinguishable Objects

A fundamental distinction in combinatorics is whether objects are treated as **distinguishable** or **indistinguishable**.

### Distinguishable objects

Objects are distinguishable if they are treated as different individual items.

Example:

$$
R_1, R_2, R_3
$$

are three different red balls.

### Indistinguishable objects

Objects are indistinguishable if only their type matters.

Example:

three red balls all counted simply as

$$
R
$$

In many problems, the same physical collection may lead to different counts depending on how the outcomes are recorded.

---

## Order and Recording Rules

In combinatorial and probabilistic problems, the way outcomes are recorded is crucial.

Examples:

* If three balls are drawn and the order of drawing is recorded, then the outcome is a sequence.
* If the same three balls are drawn but only the selected set matters, then order is ignored.
* If only colors are recorded, then objects of the same color may become indistinguishable.

Thus the same experiment may lead to different sample spaces depending on the recording rule.

---

## Product Rule and Sum Rule

If a process consists of several independent stages, and:

* the first stage can be completed in $a$ ways,
* the second in $b$ ways,
* the third in $c$ ways,

then the whole process can be completed in

$$
a \cdot b \cdot c
$$

ways.

This rule is used throughout combinatorics, especially in code construction and multi-step selections.

---

If a task can be completed in one of several mutually exclusive ways, then the total number of outcomes is the sum of the numbers of outcomes in each case.

If one case gives $a$ possibilities and another disjoint case gives $b$, then the total is

$$
a+b
$$

This rule is useful when a problem must be split into cases.
